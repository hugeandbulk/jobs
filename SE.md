Remote - United States
GitHub is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the Primer Engineering team. 

This team is responsible for evolving GitHub’s open source design system, Primer. Primer maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub UI is consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of reusable design patterns.

In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with designers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our component libraries, from designing a balanced component API to maturing components for stable release. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality UI with Primer.

If you enjoy the challenge of building design systems at scale and aim to deliver an equally empowering end user and developer experience, the Primer Engineering team at GitHub might be the place for you.

What we're looking for:
Senior Engineers at GitHub are strong individual contributors; they're given a lot of autonomy and trust to work on high impact projects. For this specific role, we're looking for someone who values the following:

Systems thinking: Our team has to apply decisions holistically, making sure to look at new patterns in context with the larger system of the product.
Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers and our design system should reflect that, which means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first can open up our product for more people.
Creating together: Getting to the best result is our focus. This may involve input and contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns – and ideally all of the above. Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product.
Progress and impact: Our team often works on the meta, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call.
Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.”
